6. Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

select name from world 
where gdp > all(select gdp from world where continent = 'Europe' and gdp > 0)


7. Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area

SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)
          
          
The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.
Using correlated subqueries

A correlated subquery works like a nested loop: the subquery only has access to rows related to a single record at a time in the outer query. The technique relies on table aliases to identify two different uses of the same table, one in the outer query and the other in the subquery.

One way to interpret the line in the WHERE clause that references the two table is “… where the correlated values are the same”.

In the example provided, you would say “select the country details from world where the population is greater than or equal to the population of all countries where the continent is the same”.


8. List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.

select continent, min(name) from world
group by continent


9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
