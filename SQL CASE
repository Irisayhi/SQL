Write a query that displays the number of players in each state, with FR, SO, JR, and SR players in separate columns and another column for the total number of players. Order results such that states with the most players come first.

select distinct state,
      count(case WHEN year = 'FR' THEN 1 else null end ) as FR_Count,
      count(case WHEN year = 'SO' THEN 1 else null end) as SO_Count, 
      count(case WHEN year = 'JR' THEN 1 else null end) as JR_Count, 
      count(case WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 1 else null end) as SR_Count, 
      count(*) 
FROM benn.college_football_players
group by state
order by count desc



Write a query that shows the number of players at schools with names that start with A through M, and the number at schools with names starting with N - Z.

SELECT CASE WHEN school_name < 'n' THEN 'A-M'
WHEN school_name >= 'n' THEN 'N-Z'
ELSE NULL END AS school_name_group,
COUNT(*) AS players
FROM benn.college_football_players
GROUP BY school_name_group
