Write a query that separates the `location` field into separate fields for latitude and longitude. 
You can compare your results against the actual `lat` and `lon` fields in the table.


SELECT location,
       trim(leading'()' from left(location, strpos(location, ',')-1 )) as latitude,
       trim(trailing '()' from right(location, strpos(location, ',')-1 )) as longitude
FROM tutorial.sf_crime_incidents_2014_01
